# Credit Card Fraud Detector ðŸ’³

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detector project! This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry, causing substantial losses each year. This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions based on a dataset of credit card transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not provided. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

- **Number of transactions:** 284,807
- **Number of fraudulent transactions:** 492

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
